(i) We have the data file which was collected in the form of Microsoft Excel csv .

(ii) By using the weka tool we have loaded our 2/3 part of the entire data to recognize the instructions how they were analyzed and the system or tool will understand it based on their classification to test the remaining data.

(iii) In the Next step, we have loaded our testing data (i.e. 1/3 part of the entire data) to test the accurate results for the target variable timely response.

(iv) We can check for every algorithm which are inbuilt in the weka tool by selecting the required variables and target variable.
