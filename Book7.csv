10/17/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"I purchased a new car on XXXX XXXX. The car dealer called Citizens Bank to get a 10 day payoff on my loan, good till XXXX XXXX. The dealer sent the check the next day. When I balanced my checkbook on XXXX XXXX. I noticed that Citizens bank had taken the automatic payment out of my checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank. I called Citizens and they stated that they did not close the loan until XXXX XXXX. ( stating that they did not receive the check until XXXX. XXXX. ). I told them that I did not believe that the check took that long to arrive. XXXX told me a check was issued to me for the amount overpaid, they deducted additional interest. Today ( XXXX XXXX, ) I called Citizens Bank again and talked to a supervisor named XXXX, because on XXXX XXXX. I received a letter that the loan had been paid in full ( dated XXXX, XXXX ) but no refund check was included. XXXX stated that they hold any over payment for 10 business days after the loan was satisfied and that my check would be mailed out on Wed. the XX/XX/XXXX.. I questioned her about the delay in posting the dealer payment and she first stated that sometimes it takes 3 or 4 business days to post, then she said they did not receive the check till XXXX XXXX I again told her that I did not believe this and asked where is my money. She then stated that they hold the over payment for 10 business days. I asked her why, and she simply said that is their policy. I asked her if I would receive interest on my money and she stated no. I believe that Citizens bank is deliberately delaying the posting of payment and the return of consumer 's money to make additional interest for the bank. If this is not illegal it should be, it does hurt the consumer and is not ethical. My amount of money lost is minimal but if they are doing this on thousands of car loans a month, then the additional interest earned for them could be staggering. I still have another car loan from Citizens Bank and I am afraid when I trade that car in another year I will run into the same problem again.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",PA,177XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,10/20/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2163100

I learned through an attempt to refinance I was unable to refinance the property due to there is no deed from XXXX found indicating my interest in the property. The only deed filed with the XXXX County Illinois Recorder was in XXXX with the original purchase of the home in which my ex-husband was the only one listed on the deed. Beneficial did file a mortgage on XXXX, XXXX on the property. I am just outraged at this point that I took out a loan on my home, yet it was never deeded in my name as one of the rightful owners. Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance, because the property I have owned for over 20 years and paying on for over 20years is considered inheritance since it was just quit claimed to me XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.",,HSBC NORTH AMERICA HOLDINGS INC.,IL,625XX,,Consent provided,Web,7/16/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1472017

My now-deceased father had a reverse mortgage ; so, essentially, my daughter refinanced the home in her name. Throughout the process of my daughter obtaining a loan from her financial lender, the reverse mortgage company and it 's attorneys pursued foreclosure. During the process of attempting to take over the property and without the knowledge of the estate, the reverse mortgage company made a highly unusual payment of taxes on the property. As the personal representative over the estate, I also paid the taxes. I was later informed through the title company that the taxes were current through XXXX 2016 and that the overage would have to be settled on the day of closing. However, instead of the title company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX Maryland XXXX remitting a check due back to me as the seller on behalf of the estate, XXXX XXXX XXXX illegally credited the reverse mortgage company money including part of what the estate had paid. In an email message to the reverse mortgage company requesting the refund due to the estate, I copied the title company. The title company 's representative was very rude responding to the message. However, in her rude response, she states that the money is/was due to the seller. XXXX XXXX in representing XXXX XXXX XXXX used her position at the company to require my daughter to send money to XXXX XXXX in order to close on the desired property. She also used her position to illegally falsify documents in order to credit the reverse mortgage company and finally made an unauthorized wire of funds to the reverse mortgage company that was due to the seller/estate. The actions of XXXX XXXX Company and/or it 's representatives lead me to question how many times they have falsified documents in hope and anticipation of the seller and buyer 's lack of knowledge.

7/6/2015,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,Settlement process and costs,,"XXXX previous case numberSince my last written complaint, Nationstar approved a HAMP but not what was originally agreed to ( Did not take off my ex husband or give me the interest rate offered by Aurora Bank ). My payment went up with this version of the HAMP but I was told my ex husband who is on the loan would be removed with this new HAMP. So, in order to get my ex husband off the loan I agreed and signed the HAMP. When I received the HAMP paperwork, I was shocked and dismayed my ex husband was still on the paperwork and I got a higher interest rate. Upon calling my rep, he explained that he would attach my divorce decree and quit claim deed where the property was quit claimed to me solely by my ex husband that this would remove his name from the loan. So, I signed and returned the paperwork regardless of the higher rate to attain this end. I attaching the email from the Nationstar rep stating that his name would be removed. I signed the paperwork with my ex husbands name on it without his signature. Nationstar signed and recorded this document ( see attached ). My ex husband served me with a lawsuit for not making payments, ruined his credit, and for not taking him off the loan. When I called Nationstar about this the said they will not remove his name off the loan, even with the paperwork I signed, the proof I sent, and the written email from their company. Now I come to find out that they fraudulently manipulated my credit report to show late payments that never occured putting my payments in a suspense account. All of my payments have been on time and I have copies of the cancelled checks to prove it so. They admitted their manipulation of the credit report however it also affected my ex husbands credit report. Their fraudulent actions not only affected me but my ex husband as well, from which I understand this is a federal offense. I am now in the XXXX year of this process. I accepted Auroras offer at 2 % and taking my ex husbands name off the loan, upon the sale of this loan to Nationstar they claim they lost the paperwork ( funny how they said they lost it but yet they accepted modified payments they said they lost XXXX. So I had to start the process all over again. I have now had to hire XXXX attorneys to try and straighten out this mess. One to defend my husbands lawsuit and the other to make Nationstar do what the said in writing. We are still going back and forth with Nationstar to do what they said.

12/8/2016,Mortgage,Home equity loan or line of credit,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"We were recently denied a settlement counter-offer on a HELOC lien held on our property address. Please know that if we had known about the lien, we would 've continued to pay on it for the past three years. Unfortunately, we were misinformed by a USAA employee in the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The reason why I reached out to USAA was in order to continue making our monthly HELOC payments. The reason they had ceased is due to our filing a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy earlier in the year. Once the Bankruptcy was discharged, I reached out to USAA to continue with payments. XXXX advises that since the HELOC was n't reaffirmed, voluntary payments were no longer necessary. I also advised how originally our XXXX XXXX XXXX home mortgage/USAA HELOC was to be included in our Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, but XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed to a Loan Modification after I filed a complaint with the US Treasury. Again, he stated that we did n't have to pay anything. He also advised we 'd no longer receive paper statements nor would we have online access to statements. In XXXX XXXX, we decided to put our house on the market in order to prepare for our XXXX son 's future. We know that he 'll be living with us for the remainder of his life. We wanted to find a house with a full basement which could eventually be modified into an in-law type suite containing a bedroom, full bathroom, kitchen, as well as a washer/dryer. This is in order for us and his XXXX to work on independent living skills in order to prepare him to become a truly independent young man. Our house sold in 4 days. In preparing the closing documents, the pre-closer advises there 's a lien from USAA on the house. She has the attorney review the bankruptcy and said that the USAA 2nd mtg was discharged in the bankruptcy BUT no lien avoidance order was filed. We need either a release from USAA ( Quitclaim deed, cancellation, etc ) to record at closing or we need a Lien Avoidance from the Bankrtupcy court. We need XXXX of these to clear title and proceed to closing. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX I called USAA and after speaking with XXXX different departments, I 'm then transferred to ext. XXXX and spoke with XXXX inquiring about a lien release. She advised a lien release would occur if the balance of {$19000.00} is paid in full. I explained to her the conversation I had with the Bankruptcy Department on XXXX XXXX and she advised that she was n't involved in that conversation and did n't know what I was told. I then asked about some sort of a negotiated amount. She advised there 's a member assistance program and faxed an application. We filled out all of the documentation including a hardship letter and faxed in our request XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We receive a call from XXXX XXXX ( I 'm not certain if it 's the same XXXX who 'm I spoke with on XXXX XXXX ) stating that it seemed that we wanted to request a settlement option, not a sell short. I advised that is correct. I advised how our house is under contract and has a closing date of XXXX XXXX. She advised that USAA legally has 30 days to make a decision and as of now, our request is incomplete. She asked for a mortgage loan payoff from BAC and pay-stubs. These items were faxed on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Our closing date is then moved to XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We also agree to pay our buyer 's rent for the month of XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating USAA rejected our settlement offer. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I then submitted a counteroffer and that too was rejected. I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX for further clarification. She advised that since we have sufficient equity in the house to cover the lien, all counters will be rejected. The full loan amount is expected from us in order to lift the Lien.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,UNITED SERVICES AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION,GA,301XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/8/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2242023

12/28/2015,Mortgage,Conventional adjustable mortgage (ARM),"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,XX/XX/XXXX my mortgage company Nationstar sent me a letter stating I was behind in my mortgage by few payments. I had just completed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. My house as well as my trustee payments were under strict compliance. I called Nationstar to resolve this issue but no one I spoke to could give me the dates of the missed payments. I spoke to a Hud councilor who referred me to the CFPB. I submitted a complaint ( case # XXXX XXXX on XXXX. Nationstar researched the problem and found XXXX payments that should have been credited to my account from their bankruptcy department. When I logged on to my account they had credited me with XXXX payments but then had taken one back out. I have since contacted the Attorney General for the state of XXXX as well as the Attorney General of XXXX. Nationstar has replied that now my missing payments were from around XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX was involved in a motion for relief during my bankruptcy. My previous mortgage co. XXXX had changed my house pymt but had not included the escrow amount. When XXXX realized the mistake they filed a motion for relief. I was instructed by my attorney to hold my house payments until the outcome of the hearing. The outcome that was settled on was for me to remit a payment of XXXX and to make XXXX additional pymts of XXXX each month beginning on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. All payments were sent to and deposited by nationstar as they had purchased my mortgage at this time. I am not behind in my mortgage payments. Nationstar continues to send letters that I am behind and I just simply want them research this and get this issue resolved.

11/21/2015,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,,"This is my fifth complaint against Key Bank because of excessive overdraft fees. I am attaching documentation that shows how confusing and dishonest Key Bank 's posting practices are. Unfortunately, this kind of theft affects people like me who do not have assets and have poor credit. Otherwise, I would have an overdraft protection account and I would never incur these fees. This is not only about my funds being low, because actually my funds are n't low right now and I incurred the last XXXX overdraft notices with a positive balance! Now that 's Key Bank Magical Accounting for you! I 'm posting this now but i am accumulating some other concerns that I am noticing now that I am having to pay attention so closely to my account and not rely on Key Bank to do the math. Some of my items disappear from the ledger at times. The other thing that is happening now is that my pending items are coming out of pending status quickly. I will be addressing these things in future complaints. This is takes an incredible amount of my time. I am doing this for other folks who for various reasons are not able to study their accounts. There is no reason why the bank can not add and subtract well enough to keep track of people 's balances. I do n't even know how much I actually have in the bank now. I do n't know how to find out either. I have a ledger that I keep for my own records and it does not coincide with Key Bank 's accounting. Key Bank changes the order of debits and credits in order to receive overdraft funds from people who do not have assets or good credit in order to protect themselves from this stealing in which this bank participates. I have attached the overdraft notice that I received this morning XX/XX/XXXX. And I have attached the ledger from XX/XX/XXXX copied at several times during the day to show first that there is no record in the ledger itself of the XXXX that is credited to the account with the deposit that I made that morning. It shows up in the balance part of the ledger at the top of the page but not in the description. In addition, this same deposit that was made at the ATM disappears later in the day. as does the XXXX debit. Where do they go? There is a note that says that Key Bank is working on the account and some items might not be available, but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items, though I was only charged for XXXX. this is very unclear unprofessional accounting. If I did not have direct deposits coming into this account, I would close it. And the thing about it is that it would not matter to key bank at all if they lost my business. They do not care about their customers as evidenced by the fact that I have spent a lot of time this week complaining because of their over draft practices and they keep overdrafting me even with a positive balance. Get it together Key Bank. Adding and Subtracting are basic math skills that you should have. Stop reordering items to benefit yourselves. Give people a break. Last month you bounced XXXX debit transactions of mine that came all together to a little over XXXX You made almost XXXX $ off of those transactions.",,KEYCORP,NY,138XX,,Consent provided,Web,11/21/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1666956

They are ruining my credit, and I ca n't get another card to pay off a high interest card with a no interest card. The new ones in question are from long ago charged off credit cards from XXXX.

4/27/2016,Consumer Loan,Vehicle loan,Managing the loan or lease,,"In XXXX of XXXX I bought a new car. The dealer told me that I would be contacted by Citizen One ( then RBS Citizens ) about the exact amount of each monthly payment and about the exact date each payment would be due. Sometime shortly after that Citizen One sent me my first monthly billing statement. For the next 2 1/2 years Citizen One set a precedent and created an expectation by regularly sending me monthly billing statements. During that time I faithfully made each payment on time and, on several occasions, made monthly payments for several months in advance. For these reasons I relied on receiving my monthly billing statement from Citizen One to know the exact amount of and the exact due date of my next loan installment. In XXXX XXXX Citizen One suddenly and unexpectedly stopped sending me billing statements. I did n't notice ( I had been habituated by their monthly notices and I had been trained to think of sending a payment only after I was notified ) and, as a direct result of Citizen One 's failure to send a monthly billing statement, I was late with my XXXX payment. When their credit department contacted me I sent 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and notified them that I had n't received a statement. Their customer service representative told me that I should have received a monthly billing statement, it was Citizen One 's policy to do so, verified my contact information ( which had n't changed ) and, under the circumstances, waived the {$20.00} fee I had been assessed for being late. She also assured me that I would start to receive monthly billing statements again. Unfortunately, I did not. Nor did I notice. As a result of that failure on the part of Citizen One I was again contacted in XXXX by their credit department that I was late again. I immediately made 2 months payments ( current + one month in advance ) and pled with their customer service department to please get a monthly billing statement to me. Mail it, fax it, e-mail it - I did n't care. Just get one to me. This time they promised to mail me a paper statement and e-mail me my reminders. To date I have n't received either. As a result I was late again in XXXX. I am not accusing Citizen One of intentionally withholding my monthly billing statements but I find it very suspicious that all of my other mail is delivered without incident. I am never - and I do mean never - late with any of my other bills. I also find it convenient ( and profitable ) that Citizen One gains from their own failure! They are now refusing to waive XXXX {$20.00} late fees. Something is very wrong on their end and it is entirely unfair that I am being penalized for not being sent a monthly billing statement which serves as notification that a loan payment in a specific amount is due. Furthermore, I should not be charged {$20.00} fees when my payment is late as a result of neglect or failure on Citizen One 's part to send me a monthly billing statement. I suspect that I am not the only customer of Citizen One with this problem. I have made exhaustive efforts to remedy this issue with the bank but they are intransigent and so I am filing this compliant to get this situation resolved and, on the principles of being fair and taking responsibility for their part in creating this problem, get the outstanding late fees waived and ensure delivery of a monthly billing statement.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",IN,460XX,,Consent provided,Web,4/29/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,1898052

9/11/2016,Credit card,,Unsolicited issuance of credit card,,"I had gone into a Wells Fargo bank when I lived in XXXX XXXX California because I lost my Debit card, the teller had me meet with one of the managers at his desk, and they tried to talk me into a college credit card I told him I did n't want another credit card and no thank you I just needed a replacement debit card. Two weeks later I received a credit card and a debit card in the mail. I was so aggravated I worked XXXX jobs and was taking XXXX units in college I did n't have time to go to the bank or to sit on the phone right away to cancel the card.

Since then I have been trying to pay this card off and close the account but it has cause me to have late payments and has just been a devstaing to my creidt and has blocked me from buying the home of my dreams.This card has been nothing but a headache affecting my ability to get a home, and a new car with a good rate this has been haunting me for a little while now. I had gone into the bank since then and told the teller and she stated I would have to call the bank. I was so shocked that someone could do this and they do n't even want to fire the guy, he was there at work that day I went in and pointed him out to the teller and all she said was to call.

10/31/2016,Credit card,,Delinquent account,,"I had a Target Red Card credit card for over three years with an unblemished payment history. My statements were sent by e-mail and I would then pay online, always in full. Last XXXX, I did not receive a statement from Target. I do not remember the exact dates for all of my financial obligations and rely on statements from my creditors. Two months later, I received an e-mail from Target informing me they were turning me over to a collection agency. I called them and told them I wanted to pay the debt in full but also wanted to cancel the card because their statement system did not seem adequate ( i.e. no statements sent ) and I could n't take any chances with ruining my credit. They informed me that it was my responsibility to know when the bills were due and if I cancelled my care, I would never be able to get another one again. I told them that was fine, this was n't working for me, and I had other credit cards. I paid the card in full and owed nothing to Target. In XXXX of 2016, I applied for new car insurance because it was much cheaper. I was told that I would have to pay {$150.00} more for insurance because I had an entry on my credit card. I got a copy of my credit report, and for the first time in my adult life ( I 'm XXXX ), I had a bad credit report from Target. I am now also applying for XXXX jobs and have found out this can also affect my ability to get a job. Target does not have any customer service contacts for this issue as I do not have a Target Red Card anymore and you need a card number to log in into the customer service portal. There is no other mechanism for contacting them about this issue. My question is, if I paid them in full two months after the debt was due, why have they ruined my credit rating? This card has cost me far more than I ever saved by using it and now it is going to potentially impair my ability to get a job. I feel as if I 've committed a felony and I would like Target to resolve this ; I do n't owe them anything and they did n't have to pay anything to collect the debt. It just seems like sheer vindictiveness, which I think stems from my not wanting to use their card anymore. I hope you can help me or direct me to help at Target.",,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,VA,221XX,,Consent provided,Web,10/31/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2186512

After 10 month of having this card I received a notice in the mail stating that they could no longer honor the original terms and would begin accessing my account the annual fee of {$990.00}.

7/29/2015,Credit reporting,,Incorrect information on credit report,Information is not mine,"On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I was checking my Credit XXXX. I discovered that on XXXX XXXX, 2015, there was a hard credit check XXXX on Equifax Credit reporting Agency. I did not open an account XXXX nor do I even have a cellphone from any company. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and advised them that I did not open an account. I was informed that indeed, an account was opened in my name and using my Social Security number. The Fraud department was closed since it was a weekend but I was advised to call back on Monday morning. I then proceeded to contact all the Credit Reporting Agencies and place an alert. I contacted EquifaxXXXX. After completing this, I contacted my credit card companies and had them place a watch on my accounts. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke with the XXXX XXXX Fraud Department and filed a Fraud complaint. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a letter from the XXXX XXXX Fraud Department advising that the account in my name was fraudulent. I contacted the XXXX Fraud Department on this date by telephone. I was told that the fraudulent account was closed and a letter was sent to Equifax requesting that the Credit Check be removed from my credit report. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I contacted Equifax. Equifax is the only Credit Reporting Agency where this credit check appeared. I spoke with XXXX at XXXX. I asked her why the credit check was still on my credit report. XXXX stated that she does not show a letter XXXX in my file. As a result of this conversation, I contacted XXXX again. I was advised that they did in deed send a letter to Equifax requesting that the credit check be removed. Further, I did a cover letter and sent Equifax a copy of the letter which I received XXXX. This was sent in a fax for which I have a confirmation of receipt. My letter also requested that the credit check be removed immediately. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a letter from a third party company indicating that a hack had occurred on a company called XXXX. XXXX is a company that operates for XXXX, Florida XXXX. In this hack, employee and retired employee names, addresses, Social Security numbers, email addresses, pass words, etc. had been stolen. Obviously, this is where the suspect in the XXXX fraudulent account obtained my name and Social Security number. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called XXXX XXXX Fraud Department. I advised them that Equifax claims that they did not send a letter to remove the fraudulent credit check. I was informed that this was not true. While on the telephone, the employee typed out another letter to Equifax and sent it. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I called Equifax again. The credit check XXXX is still showing on my credit report. The employee at Equifax told me that they have no documentation showing this credit check to be a fraud. I told the employee that she is a liar. I stated that I have the confirmation in which I faxed them my statement along with the XXXX letter. I then informed the employee that XXXX sent them another letter and I wanted to speak to a supervisor. The employee stated that there was nothing that could be done for me and the credit check only lasts on my report for two years. I told her that she was complicit in this fraud complaint and that she is a liar. As a result of this last conversation with Equifax, I contacted the Attorney General 's Office and was advised to file this complaint. See the attached documentation.

My current card has an annual cycle system for cash back, which means that the cash back I get depends upon the purchases I have made with this card during a 12 month period. My cycle starts on XXXX of XXXX of each year, and I get a lower cash back percentage for the first {$6500.00} I spend with this card, and after that I get more cash back percentage. This year 's cycle also started on XXXX of XXXX, and in the past 4 months, I have made most of my purchases with this card so that I reach the {$6500.00} limit as soon as possible, and start getting more cash back. Now, just when I am about to reach this limit, the credit card company has sent me a letter notifying me that my card has been converted to a different type, which has a completely different cash back system, and as a result, I would receive much lower cash back compared to what I would have gotten with the old card upon reaching the {$6500.00} limit. I contacted their customer service many times and all of their agents understood my issue, but ultimately did n't do anything other than apologizing to me. I told to the agents that this is cheating, and they said that this is a company-wide policy and they have no control on it. As a solution, I offered them to change my card after my current cycle ends, but they denied it.

I was advised that I had to make a payment XXXX then call in to make them aware the payment was to go to the principal only. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I made a {$1000.00} payment towards my principal and called in as I was advised to do. The company applied so much towards the payment and the rest towards the interest. I kept calling in to have this corrected. The company kept saying it was being taken care of. My XXXX/XXXX/15 statement came and stated the balance was {$7500.00} and a principal of {$7400.00}.

I had a credit card linked with the bank and asked to close that as well which they said they could and did. I told customer service at this time that I have not received a bill for the credit card either by email or by mail and they said it was just being sent out and I would receive it in the next few weeks. I am in the market to buy a house and found out that Key Bank put a nonpayment on my credit report. I called customer service again in XXXX several times, each time being disconnected or being passed around to the wrong department. My initial {$29.00} bill had become {$130.00}. I had still not received a billing statement and did not want to pay all the late fees etc and admit that I was at fault without a bill. After several more calls in XXXX, and being passed around to different bank departments I was still not able to talk with the right people regarding paying my bill and fixing my credit. I contacted the bank in XXXX and was told they would request all the fees dismissed and asked me to call back in a few days. I called back and was told all fees were dropped but they had no authority to fix my credit even though they stated they were at fault. I paid the {$29.00} that I owed and was told that I would have to submit a complaint to the cfpb to have my credit fixed. I am very angry that my credit can be destroyed without my knowledge when I am not at fault. It has cost me much time in phone calls, disconnects etc. I am waiting for it to be fixed so that I can get a mortgage without having to pay a higher interest rate. Key Bank customer service stated that this has been happening to other customers but it seems like they have done nothing to fix the problem of billing and causing hardship to customers.",,KEYCORP,OH,801XX,,Consent provided,Web,12/14/2016,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,No,2247469

To my surprise only the XXXX agency has complied. There is still a short statement on my Equifax report the exact opposite of what I legally had requested removed under federal rights!

XXXX loan had a principal amount of $ XXXX and the second note of {$4000.00}. The notes now state the principal amounts are ~ $ XXXX and ~ $ XXXX. My daughter has been paying interest only on these notes for 11 years. She was constantly encourage to defer her loans. An income based repayment plan was never offered. My daughter and her husband are on their XXXX child. In XX/XX/XXXX, Navient increased their payment by twice the amount. My daughter 's attempts to refinance this note have been ignored and at one point a rep told her they would just get the money from me - my credit cards had plenty of room as she could see it right there in my credit report. My daughter just gave birth to her XXXX child who has a XXXX which requires XXXX. Her other XXXX children are XXXX and under. Her husband is the sole support for the family. After numerous calls with Navient and letters I called them as I had a letter that a settlement was possible- first the rep denied that was what the letter said. I offered a much lesser amount stating the funds were coming out of a small retirement account. The rep finally said she was authorized to settle for $ XXXX. When I replied this was beyond my means and could she do better after a long argument, she transferred me to a supervisor. The supervisor said she knew nothing of my call before I was transferred and proceeddd to bully me about my daughter 's note. I continued to state I wanted to find a way to settle the note that my daughter could not repay it and I could not afford to pay another bill. The tactics used are nothing short of bullying, then they roll to empathy and back to bullying. This representative told me Navient would never settle and that I could pay {$5000.00} to get my name off the loan. Forty five minutes later and exhausted I just excused myself to get back to work. The rep left me with a threatening remark about forwarding me to collections. Navient is now calling my work number at least once a week. They call my cell phone daily and they send letters in envelopes with no return address. My daughter suffers the same harassment and they are now even calling her mother-in-law. My complaint is that my daughter was n't informed on the impact of deferring her loan. They 've refused to work with her on an income based plan. While I accept responsibility for signing the loans I would expect after 12 years and all the interest already collected, Navient would make an effort to refinance this note instead of using scare tactics.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NH,030XX,,Consent provided,Web,3/22/2017,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2396836

In addition, when I called Discover their Customer Service did n't seem to verify my identity and a Fraud Specialist by the name of XXXX offered to reset my online password.

I owe XXXX $ a month and was paying {$1000.00} every month before the end of the month, it was just after the XXXX of the month causing me to have a XXXX $ late fee. I was n't too worried about the late fee, just did n't like being late due to the way my paychecks fell. He proposed that I not pay XXXX to give me time to save up the extra payment then for the next 6 months pay XXXX $ that would end up covering the missed payment in XXXX and my payments would not be due till the XXXX. That sounded great. I said sure. I received an agreement in the mail that said no need to respond to continue on about this payment plan just make the payments as follows. I did and I paid the XXXX $ on time like i was supposed to do. Come XXXX I received a certified letter in attempt to collect a debt from my past due payment for XXXX for Chase. I called and they said yes that is correct, although I had a payment arrangement they were still required to turn in I was past due for not making XXXX payment. I was really really upset! Had I known this would effect my credit I would have continued to pay the XXXX $ late fee. That was n't bothering me!! I paid up my mortgage to get out of this plan and so it would not be turned into the credit burrow anymore. I spoke with a representative who said he would look into this. He called me back and said unfortunately they can not do anything to fix what had been turned into the credit burrow, he could however send me a letter saying I am up to date. That does not fix my credit! That also does not matter to anyone trying to give me a loan! I have never missed a payment until I was told NOT to pay XXXX.

2/9/2017,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,"Loan servicing, payments, escrow account",,"To whom it may concern I am filing a complaint against my current Mortgage Company Shell Point Mortgage. I 'm currently having trouble, regarding my mortgage payments they ca n't seem to get my account right. My mortgage was sold to Shellpoint Mortgage in XX/XX/2016, from XXXX. Prior to being sold I had to do a loan modification due to me having my XXXX from my XXXX and losing my job due to my illnesses. XXXX helped me with a loan modification. My trial payments would start in XX/XX/2016 at XXXX a month but prior of starting my trial payments I had become XXXX from the military which gives me the benefit of not having to pay taxes on my home. Prior to starting the mod, XXXX recalculated my mod payment in the amount was XXXX a month which were paid on time. On XX/XX/XXXX I had sent my payment for XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX in the amount of XXXX. XXXX informed to stop payment on check due to my mortgage being sold to Shell Point Mortgage. I contacted Shell point Mortgage to find out payment information they could not tell me anything due to them not knowing about the file. They informed me that I would receive a welcome letter in the mail which I did not receive until XX/XX/XXXX. I did received a bill saying that I owe I believe at that time {$8000.00} I had contacted Shell Point Mortgage to find out the problem and they could not tell me because their file was not completed according to them they did not have all the information. I explained what was going on with the modification and explained the XXXX a month and how XXXX came about the amount. I was told to contact XXXX myself to get their paperwork from them due to the privacy act. Shell Point could not get it to complete the file, I contacted XXXX for the paperwork they sent me the paperwork in the mail. The people at XXXX asked why I was requesting the paperwork. I needed to get it due to the privacy act. They stated that Shell Point should have called them since they sold them the account. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a welcome letter in the mail about my payments they wanted 9 payments of XXXX a month I believe it was about XXXX dollars, On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Shell point Mortgage and the gentleman told me to go ahead and send XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment in the amount of {$1600.00} they should have everything together by then which I did and on XX/XX/XXXX Shell Point Mortgage had returned XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment because they could not accept partial payments, they are still under assumption that I still owe from XX/XX/2016. Shell point Mortgage still could not understand the XXXX a month. So nothing got solved. XX/XX/XXXX payment was sent and Shell Point Mortgage kept that payment of {$810.00}. When I called about the payment no one understood where it went at this time, now I 'm talking to a gentlemen name XXXX who was taking care of my loan and found out it was sent to XX/XX/2016 payment. Now telling him how did they accept XX/XX/XXXX payment for {$810.00} and not XX/XX/XXXX. Payment And he stated that 's where the payments are in default which did not make any sense. So I was told not to make XX/XX/XXXX payment by XXXX until this got resolved, all through XX/XX/XXXX nothing has been solved XXXX states that my payment are {$1200.00} a month even after Shell Point Mortgage was contacted by XXXX from XXXX who I believe is vice president and spoke to them directly about my account and gave them what they needed. I spoke with XXXX and explained that I was not going to pay {$1200.00} that was not my payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me and said it was ok for me to send my payments back to them for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which I did on XX/XX/XXXX in total amount {$3200.00}.

8/22/2016,Mortgage,Conventional fixed mortgage,"Loan modification,collection,foreclosure",,"Currently, my loan is being serviced by Ocwen Loan Servicing ( OLS ) it was transferred from Homecomings Financial Network in XX/XX/XXXX.At the time of the transfer the loan payment break downs were principle and interest payments of {$1600.00} and Taxes and insurance in the amounts of {$430.00}. I was able to make the payments of {$2000.00} with no problem, until after having lost income as a result of my wife and I going through a separation and I became very ill from health complications.I received a trial modification approval from OLS, for my home loan on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, starting XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I proceeded to pay all XXXX trial payments as the agreement had instructed. Shortly after receiving what was to be a permanent loan modification, I quickly identified a number of inconsistences within the recapitalized arrears. In particularly the escrow increases, and the adjusted outstanding principle balance as a result of these changes. My fourth payment was also denied during the grievance or 30 day appeal process. I felt bullied into signing and returning and agreement that was not completely transparent and did not make mathematical sense how my escrow increases could possibly be so severe over the years while my loan was with OLS.During the 30 day modification appeal process, I was refused the opportunity to receive a full explanation as to how my escrow balances were calculated as follows : *INS. IN XX/XX/XXXX THRU XX/XX/XXXX {$3600.00} AND STARTED TO SPIKE FROM THERE. MY INS. POLICY INCREASED IN XX/XX/XXXX TO XX/XX/XXXX TO {$5800.00} ( {$2200.00} INCREASE ) THE FOLLOWING DISBURSEMENTS ( DIS. ) WERE MADE BY OLS : XXXX INS. DIS. - XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- {$5800.00}, XXXX INS. DIS -XX/XX/XXXX -- {$1900.00}, XXXX INS. DIS. XXXX XXXX, XXXX -- {$2100.00} These erratic increases began shortly after my loan was transferred to OLS on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Furthermore OLS has also failed to show me how my XXXX trial payments were applied to the loan balance after they sent me to foreclosure. A Letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, was received at my residence, rescinding my loan modification offer after making the XXXX trial payments outlined within the agreement. I also received a pre-foreclosure referral letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which allowed me no time to respond to the cancellation to my loan modification.I called on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, which just so happens to also be the same day that OLS sent me a notice of default. I have also served OLS with a ( QWR ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they have failed to respond within the allotted time per RESPA. I have reason to believe that there is unclear chain of title to my property, and my land records do not match the plot indicated on my Deed of Trust. The land records for my parcel indicates XXXX acres, which means that I would own my land which their home sits on, making it impossible for them to sell their home neighbors ' homes with clear title. My loan may potentially invalid based on the land parcels alone. OLS, has no desire to explain these issues and wish only to foreclose on my home to capitalize on what equity is there, as well as a XXXX grant they received from the hardest hit fund of Tennessee. I 'm seeking your help in the matters within this complaint, surrounding possible insurance fraud, misapplication of payments, dual tracking, and distorted chain of title and or land recordings for my loan.

I was approved for the refinancing but the interest rate that I was given is rather high, and is higher than what I 'm currently paying PLUS my XXXX score is higher. I called to speak with someone so that I could be explained why I was offered such a high rate. The customer service rep could not explain it, said that its just computer generated, and the underwriting team does not talk to customers. I asked if I could be provided an explanation in writing, or even what credit score was used to offer the rate and he would not tell me. This seems quite unfair and now I have a hit on my credit, and I feel as though I have been subject to a bait and switch.",,"CITIZENS FINANCIAL GROUP, INC.",GA,303XX,,Consent provided,Web,9/14/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2103173

However I am NEVER offered options and instead told I must pay, in spite of my situation. I feel harassed by these calls as they will take place several times in one day, and in some cases the people have been rude. One occasion they asked me how am I able to pay other bills and this is really none of their business how I am managing. I was then told 'okay so you refuse to answer '. Their wording of my questions is that I am solely to blame. Furthermore, I have been paying off these loans diligently and have obeyed all their rules since I took these loans out in XX/XX/XXXX. Repayment began in XX/XX/XXXX and I have been paying regularly since then with more than % 8 interest. I am trapped in this interest rate and it is extremely difficult for me.

2/15/2017,Bank account or service,Checking account,"Account opening, closing, or management",,"To whom this may concern, I opened a Citibank Account Package with Regular Checking account online on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with the promo code CZPE with a promotional bonus offer of {$400.00}. After spending weeks unsuccessfully trying to access my existing Citibank online account due to Citibank online account conflict issue with their credit card account system, I was finally able to submit an opening deposit of {$15000.00} on Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. However, their system did not process the deposit and showed a deposit date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I immediately called Citibank about the delay and was assured that the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX deposit date will NOT affect my eligibility claim as they do not process deposits over the weekend. I was told that since XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was on Saturday, the cut off date is the next business day which is Monday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 90 days later, I 've contacted Citibank again and was told that the bonus should actually arrive on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which is 120 days after the initial deposit ( 30 days of meeting deposit minimum and 90 days to be credited ). Now it 's been more than 120 days and I 've contacted them again, and was told that I 'm not eligible for the promotion although false information was given to me the previous times that I 've contacted them. I am very concern that a major bank will outright tell lies to consumers by providing incorrect statements. This is not acceptable for a major bank institution. I have kept records of online chat sessions with Citibank and taken notes of all calls and phone inquires. I have not been able to get anywhere with my direct interactions with Citibank due to misinformation being provided me and lack of escalation options. I need your assistance in supporting my claim on this matter and bring this to the attention of the public, so others wo n't get misled by this institution and their deceptive practices.

Nothing has been credited despite these communications. now the answer i know i will get based on past experience is that the bank despite the time and money they spend fighting me will still not refund me. of course i was tricked into using the card XXXX XXXX which i would not have done .and only did based on being told i would be refunded.
